This project aims at developing a complete framework to perform multi-physics simulations in which a component can be suitably described by the software MBDyn.  

Starting from the current \textit{MBDyn-adapter}, with the development of new features and an in-depth validation with experimental data, the complete set-up can be used as a support for both academic and industrial research in many different fields, allowing to build a \textit{digital twin} for systems involving multi-body, fluid dynamics and control.
