This project aims at developing a complete framework useful to perform multi-physics co-simulations in which a model component can be suitably described by the multi-body dynamics software MBDyn.  

Starting from the current \textit{MBDyn-adapter}, with the development of new features, the integration to other fluid or solid solvers and an in-depth validation made comparing experimental data, the complete set-up can be used as a support for both academic and industrial research in many different fields, allowing to build a \textit{digital twin} for many systems involving multi-body, fluid dynamics and control.
