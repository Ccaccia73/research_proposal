This project aims at developing a complete framework useful to perform multi-physics co-simulations in which a model component can be suitably described by the multi-body dynamics software MBDyn.  
The project aims at completing and extending the work started with the implementation of the preCICE-MBDyn adapter, developed in the author's master thesis, used to perform fluid-structure interaction simulations.

With the introduction of some new features, with the integration to other fluid or solid solvers and with an in-depth validation made comparing experimental data, the complete set-up can be used as a support for both academic and industrial research in many different fields, allowing to build a \textit{digital twin}
