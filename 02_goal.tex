\subsection*{Project Objectives}


\subsubsection*{Background}

Focusing on the structural part of the co-simulation, general purpose FEM codes allow to solve a wide range of problems. Nevertheless, even with today's computers and using finite elements techniques, it is not always feasible or convenient to treat a solid as a 3D continuum. Bodies with particular geometric features can be seen as lower dimension ones, with respect to the governing equations \cite{hjelmstad2007fundamentals} (e.g.\ \textit{beams}, \textit{plates} or \textit{shells}).

MBDyn is a free general-purpose Multibody Dynamics solver which models the constrained nonlinear dynamics of rigid and flexible bodies formulated as sets of Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAEs) \cite{masarati2014efficient}. It models slender deformable components using an original, geometrically exact finite volume formulation for beam elements with a high level of flexibility \cite{ghiringhelli2000multibody,bauchau2016validation}. MBDyn is also able to exchange kinematics and load information with a cloud of external points of arbitrary topology \cite{quaranta2005conservative} and so is open to be connected to external software to perform partitioned FSI simulations.

An \textit{adapter} to connect MBDyn and preCICE has been developed in \cite{caccia2020master}, and it has been validated (\cite{caccia2021coupling}, submitted for publication) though a set of well-known benchmarks composed of a laminar incompressible flow around a slender elastic object (\cite{ramm1998fluid}, \cite{turek2006proposal}, \cite{turek2010numerical}).

\subsubsection*{Goal}

This proposal stems from the work presented in \cite{caccia2020master} and \cite{caccia2021coupling}, with the purpose of extending the current capabilities of the set-up and the variety of problems to be solved.

The idea is to develop and validate a complete framework to be used to perform FSI simulations adopting multi-body dynamics for the structural part. The connection to the library preCICE has the twofold advantage of using state of the art coupling algorithms (\cite{mehl2016parallel}, \cite{bungartz2016precice}, \cite{degroote2009performance}) and state of the art CFD solvers \cite{uekermann2017official} (e.g.\ \textit{OpenFOAM} or \textit{SU2}).

The number of applications benefiting of this framework would be vast, just to name a few:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rotorcraft integrated dynamics analysis is a difficult task \cite{quaranta2004toward},  but the standardized coupling interface would allow to use the best solver for the specific design phase, from mid fidelity solvers \cite{cocco2020simulation} to full CFD when needed (e.g.\ \cite{cavagna2009simulation}  \cite{masarati2011coupled}).
    \item Flexible wings are a growing research topic (\cite{pusch2019aeroelastic}, \cite{waitman2020h}): complex wing sections can be described by the MBDyn beam model
    \item wind turbines \cite{}
\end{itemize}
