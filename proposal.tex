\section*{Summary of the Project}

\hl{todo}

%Write a brief summary of the proposal. The summary should not exceed 120 words and best be a paragraph long. The summary should include a few lines about the background information, the main research question or problem that you want to write about, and your research methods. The proposal summary should not contain any references or citations. Remember that your entire proposal cannot exceed 1500 words, so choose the words in this section carefully. The 1500 words you will write in the proposal document will exclude any words contained in the tables, figures, and references. You can use this template for writing your proposal.

\input{02_goal}

%You insert a separate section here and write about the goal(s) of your research and the objectives that will meet the goal. Typically, the way to write this is something like, "The goal of this research is to ...", and then continue with something like, "Goal 1 will be met by achieving the following objectives ...", and so on. The goal is a broad based statement, and the objectives are very specific, achievable series of statements that will show how you will achieve the goal you set out.
